Hello there! 
My name is Oscar. At the moment I am into the university program "Development and management of software systems" (in
swedish we just call it 'UDM', which stands for "Utveckling och drift av mjukvarusystem"). However I can really feel
that the standards are high and we need to learn a lot, which is great! You realise you didn't know that much after all,
and you are learning new stuff everyday.
